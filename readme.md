# Information Retrieval for Two Datasets from IR-Datasets

## Datasets
1. **Antique\Train**
2. **Lotte\science\dev\form**

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an information retrieval system using:
- **Python** for the core logic.
- **NestJS** for the backend system.
- **Flutter** for the frontend system.

## Evaluation Metrics
The system is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Recall
- Precision@10
- MAP (Mean Average Precision)
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)

## Backend Setup
To run the backend system, ensure you have a Chroma server installed on your PC. Follow these steps to initialize the backend:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Frontend Setup
For the frontend, you must install the required packages inside the Flutter project. Use the following command:

```sh
flutter pub get
```
